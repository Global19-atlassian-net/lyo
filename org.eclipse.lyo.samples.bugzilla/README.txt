The Lyo Bugzilla adapter can now be found in the OSLC4JBugzilla project in the Lyo doc Git repository:

http://git.eclipse.org/gitroot/lyo/org.eclipse.lyo.docs.git

The adapter is in the doc repository since it represents the completed version of the OSLC4 workshop found there.   
In the future it may move to this repository, but for now it is located at that location.

See http://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/BuildOSLC4JBugzilla for info on building and running the adapter.
